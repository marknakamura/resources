# Resources
This repository is simply a list of helpful things that I've seen and saved over the years.

It contains tools, training, videos, articles, social media handles, etc.

This is quite a long list, which continues to grow as I continue my own learning journey.  I believe there's something here for everyone.

If you'd like to contribute, please feel free to drop a comment.
