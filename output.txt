- Azure Active Directory security operations guide - Microsoft has a successful and proven approach to Zero Trust security using Defense in Depth principles that use identity as a control plane. Organizations continue to embrace a hybrid workload world for scale, cost savings, and security. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) plays a pivotal role in your strategy for identity management. Recently, news surrounding identity and security compromise has increasingly prompted enterprise IT to consider their identity security posture as a measurement of defensive security success.

- Falco - Falco is a cloud native runtime security tool for Linux operating systems. It is designed to detect and alert on abnormal behavior and potential security threats in real-time. At its core, Falco is a kernel monitoring and detection agent that observes events, such as syscalls, based on custom rules. Falco can enhance these events by integrating metadata from the container runtime and Kubernetes. The collected events can be analyzed off-host in SIEM or data lake systems.

- Tetragon - Cilium Tetragon component enables powerful realtime, eBPF-based Security Observability and Runtime Enforcement.
Tetragon detects and is able to react to security-significant events, such as
Process execution events
System call activity
I/O activity including network & file access
When used in a Kubernetes environment, Tetragon is Kubernetes-aware - that is, it understands Kubernetes identities such as namespaces, pods and so-on - so that security event detection can be configured in relation to individual workloads.
